Data storytelling is a potent skill that encapsulates the art of communicating meaningful interpretations from a raw dataset effectively. Combining narratives and visual elements, it portrays the insights derived from data analysis in a manner that is comprehensible and engaging. This technique allows the audience to grasp the significance of these insights in a specific context, and compels them toward actionable steps.

The three fundamental components that structure an impactful data storytelling are:

- **Data:** The inception of a data story is a comprehensive and exact analysis of data. Exploiting methods like descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis constructs a panoramic view of the data. For instance, a descriptive analysis could show a drop in a product's sales, diagnostic analysis could reveal the reasons behind the drop, predictive analysis could indicate future trends if the situation persists, and prescriptive analysis could suggest solutions to revert the trend.

- **Narrative:** The narrative or storyline, whether conveyed orally or written, breathes life into the numbers and facts derived from the data analysis. It presents the insights in a coherent and eloquent manner, explaining the context and promoting the recommended actions. In the same sales drop situation, the narrative could reveal a competitor's aggressive pricing strategy caused it, and suggest launching a targeted promotional campaign to regain market shares.

- **Visualizations:** A picture is worth a thousand words, and this fits perfectly in the context of data storytelling. Visual elements such as charts, graphs, diagrams, images, or videos transform complex numerical data into clear, engaging, and memorable content. A sales trend graph, for example, could visualize the product's dropping sales and offer a forecast of future trends considering the competitive pricing.
Data storytelling can serve both internal and external purposes. Internally, it can highlight the need for enhancements in a product based on user feedback data or reveal the effect of a marketing campaign on customer acquisition. Externally, it can powerfully show potential customers the merits of your product based on the success stories and thereby assist in sales growth (Catherine Cote, 2021).
