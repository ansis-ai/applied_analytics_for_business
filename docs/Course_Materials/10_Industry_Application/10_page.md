In a competitive business landscape, customer satisfaction is a key indicator of business success. In the first scenario, an airline company faced a challenging situation due to dwindling customer satisfaction ratings. The prevalent issue was primarily tied to the firm's rudimentary rebooking methods which lacked the finesse and sophistication expected by its discerning clientele.
To transform and enhance these rebooking procedures, the airline company recognized the need to not only incorporate and leverage real-time corporate data, but also to consider additional factors making each rebooking decision. As a proactive measure, the flight route to Frankfurt was selected as a benchmark, a trial to test the waters and assess the impact of these strategic adjustments on their future business directions.

<br>
Meanwhile, in a separate set of circumstances, a financial institution, which specializing in processing credit card transactions faced a predicament of different nature but of no lesser significance. This company observed a substantial surge in chargebacks, a situation that put the security of their systems under serious doubt. Fearful of a data breach and its potential ramifications, they were under the impression that their systems may have been compromised.

## Case of the Misconnecting Passengers

- Business Problem: Air London, a prominent airline company, was facing a series of grave challenges related to their flight connectivity that was impacting their overall business. The problem first became apparent at their Frankfurt hub, creating a ripple effect that was displeasing to their customers and hurtful to their business.

<br>
A significant incident that contributed to the declining customer satisfaction ratings involved a case of severe misconnection. Unfortunately, four passengers bound to London missed out onto their designated flight due to this connectivity issue. And to make matters worse, there were only two vacant seats left on the last flight scheduled for the day. Speculating from the ground reality, Air London was put in a tough position struggling to find a satisfactory solution to re-accommodate these four aggrieved passengers.

<br>
The quest to resolve the misconnection crisis was not a smooth one either. To establish the root cause, the staff needed to sift through various data sources manually. This was an onerous and time-consuming task that relied heavily on human effort and lacked the benefit of technological aid.

<br>
Further compounding the issue was a technological deficit within Air London's operational setup. There was a glaring lack of real-time visibility pertaining to flight cancellations, postponements, and other relevant operational issues. This inadequacy hindered the efficient management of passenger connections, leading to an environment of uncertainty and inconvenience both for the passengers and the airline.

<br>
In summary, Air London faced a twofold problem - on one front there was a needs-based improvement for technological infrastructure, and on the other, there were operational challenges that required robust solutions for improving customer service and general business performance.

- Proposed Solution: Detailed Insights into the Misconnect Situation.  In response to the troubling misconnect circumstances at Air London, the team put forth a practical and data-driven recommendation to mitigate the problem. This solution involved the implementation of a real-time data warehousing methodology that capitalised on the strength of analytics technology.  The aim was to use its capabilities and mold them into an effective solution to Air London’s predicament.

The proposed method endorsed the idea of secure storage for passenger data. The mode chosen for this storage was a relational database, a prevalent repository type that uses a structured scheme to store data. To optimally analyse this systematically stored data and derive critical insights, they decided to utilise powerful predictive modelling tools provided by the SAS group and Teradata Value Analyzer. The joint use of these tools allowed for an extensive and insightful exploration of the databank in real time.

<br>
A significant aspect of this data analysis process was the selection of superior rebooking variables. These variables, chosen with careful consideration of their impact and relevance to the business, included elements such as frequent flyer miles, lifetime value, booking frequency, profitability, and the cost and utilization of different channels. Moreover, any unusual circumstances, such as exceptional flight delays or cancellations, were also added to the list of considerations. These rebooking variables served as a comprehensive toolkit for identifying and understanding customer requirements and behavioural patterns.
These data-driven strategies were formulated with the objective of achieving a triple-fold effect. First and foremost, they endeavoured to maximize customer satisfaction by making rebooking a seamless and hassle-free experience. Additionally, on a broader and more strategic note, these tactics aimed to maintain, if not improve, the profitability of the airline. Lastly, the ultimate goal was to uplift the airline’s overall business outcomes by harnessing the power of data and technology.

## Case of the credit card breach: 
- Business Problem: The credit card breach situation emerges as a notable case highlighting critical issues that can pose significant threats to business operations. The alarming episode began when fraudulent transactions linked to credit cards were reported to the clearing bank.

This unusual activity underlined a potential security weakness in the credit card mechanism, possibly pointing towards an uncomfortable scenario involving hackers. A security breach of this nature does not just expose sensitive customer information; it also threatens the trust built between the business and its clientele.

<br>
Adding to the problem was the absence of a centralized data storage system. In an age where data comparison and trend analysis are critical to proactive security measures, this absence posed serious challenges. It made it troublesome for the IT department to compare system data, thereby hindering their efforts in vulnerability detection and system fortification.

<br>
These obstacles made it particularly hard to identify the exact source of the security breach. After a thorough initial investigation involving both front-end and back-end systems, the results illustrated a rather surprising picture. The systems were found to be free of any external intrusions and the role and time-based security access controls, set in place using a reputable data protection and security software solution, Protegrity, showed no signs of security risk.

<br>
These findings prompted a change in perspective, suggesting that the problem might be originating from within the system rather than an outside source. This suspicion grew stronger when an unusual query was discovered in the system. The query - select *, typically used to retrieve all data from a database, was implemented on orders and customers. This abnormal query activity coupled with the suddenly ceased credit card data 'touches' in the SQL servers painted a worrying picture.

<br>
In addition, the IT department had been using a different operational database system, Oracle, that did not fall under the safety net of Protegrity's surveillance. The use of an unmonitored operational database system could potentially have created an unseen vulnerability, providing further insights into the complexities of this case. The situation at hand required a solution that was both comprehensive and effective, something robust enough to handle the scale and severity of the issue.

- Proposed Solution: In-depth Overview of the Credit Card Breach In the wake of the disruptive credit card breach within the organization, the team stepped up with a robust and well-architected data warehousing solution. It was a comprehensive strategy built atop the leading-edge data analytics technology aimed at stopping similar breaches in the future and strengthening the overall security structure. This technology has made its mark in the industry for masterfully handling large data sets and performing complex queries at high speeds, making it a suitable pick given the circumstances..

<br>
The solution was to amalgamate multiple, scattered consumer data sources into one cohesive data warehouse. This unified data storage would make it easier to manage, monitor, and analyse the diverse data sets in a real-time environment. More importantly, it could provide valuable insights into any anomalous activity and serve as an effective early warning system for potential security breaches. Simultaneously with the technical measures, a client-facing strategy was also devised to manage the ongoing crisis efficiently. Immediate steps were taken to communicate the issue to the customers, employing both phone calls and letters. Both these channels were utilized to deliver new credit cards to the affected customers promptly. These interactions were not just transactional, thought. The communications also encompassed heartfelt apologies for the inconvenience caused to the customers and earnest assurances of improved security measures. 

<br>
A structured follow-up system was put in place as well, with subsequent phone calls ensuring that the customer concerns are addressed, and their confidence in the company was being reinstated. Another aspect of the new security strategy was to incorporate Protegrity software into the company’s IT ecosystem. Known for its state-of-the-art data security solutions, Protegrity would help reinforce the protection around the organization’s data centres, ensuring the stored data’s safety and integrity. Lastly, the company decided to pursue an external audit of the ongoing security measures. Recognizing the need for an unbiased and expert evaluation of the security solutions, The team called in qualified auditors to perform a thorough Payment Card Industry (PCI) compliance audit. This audit would not only validate the company's adherence to the industry's best security practices but also provide actionable insights into any potential areas that may require further improvement.

<br>
The comprehensive solution presented for the two cases stands out as an illustrative model, demonstrating the efficacious use of data warehousing technology to tackle real-world business challenges. The underpinning essence of this model is focused on the prompt identification and resolution of business disruptions. This core objective can be achieved most effectively through the diligent administration of data, in-depth data analysis, and seamless communication channels.

<br>
In the contemporary commercial landscape, businesses thrive in an ecosystem where data is the driving force. Hence, a perceptive investment in data management and mastery over analytics skills isn't just an optional asset; it becomes a crucial requirement for survival and growth. These competencies provide businesses with an indispensable capability to decode complex patterns, predict trends, and make informed decisions.

<br>
Additionally, fostering a culture of cross-functional collaboration amplifies the power of an organization. When different functional units collaborate effectively, an organization can achieve a more holistic perspective. This broader perspective, coupled with the application of state-of-the-art analytics, equips organizations with the necessary toolset to dissect the anatomy of their problems. It empowers them to probe deeper and discover the primary sources causing these issues.

<br>
Once the root cause is diagnosed, organizations can strategize and implement effective remedies to rectify the identified problems. These remedial measures can bring about substantial improvements in various operational parameters. On-time performance may witness heightened efficiency, leading to significant service quality improvements.
Simultaneously, a systematic problem-solving approach enhances the reciprocal relationship between the institution and its customers. As the organization demonstrates reliability and efficiency, customer happiness sees a natural uptick, and consumer confidence strengthens.

<br>
These advancements, though they may seem fragmented, interlock to form a harmonious wheel driving the organization towards success. Each improvement contributes to enhancing the organization's overall performance, making it a more formidable player in the competitive business scenario.
