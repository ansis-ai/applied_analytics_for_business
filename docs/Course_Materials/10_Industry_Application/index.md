## Analysis of real-world business cases and challenges using analytics techniques

In today's dynamic business environment, data stands as a precious asset. It's not only crucial for business professionals to understand and interpret data but also to articulate their findings effectively. This competency plays a prominent role in making well-informed decisions.

<br>
"The provision of data-backed insights in decision-making processes holds immense power, especially when there's a massive shortage of professionals skilled in these areas in many companies," asserts Jan Hammond, a professor at Harvard Business School. Hammond, who instructs an online course in Business Analytics, firmly believes that this trend of data-driven decisions is shaping the future of business (Matt Gavin, 2019).

- **Analytics in Finance and Banking:** The modern banking sector finds itself continually swamped by an inflow of digital data that is growing exponentially. Each second increases the sector's data footprint significantly. As per predictions by the Global Data Consortium (GDC), this volume of data is slated to inflate by an incredible 700 percent by the end of the upcoming year. This mammoth data growth is not just a challenge, but looking from another perspective, it's indeed an opportunity for the banks, if harnessed properly. A meticulous study, paired with a systematic analysis of this data avalanche, can bring to light any illicit financial activities that might be happening beneath the surface.

- **Analytics in Marketing:** In earlier times, traditional marketing methods such as surveys and one-on-one customer interactions constituted the crux of advertising strategies. Companies would broadcast their offerings via mediums like radio and TV channels, printed adverts in newspapers, and generously sized billboards on roadsides. The drawback, however, was that the effectiveness of these advertisements on their intended audience was largely unknown.

<br>
However, with the proliferation of the internet and the emergence of cutting-edge technologies like big data, a digital transformation was set forth in the realm of marketing - thus birthing Digital Marketing. This contemporary approach empowers businesses to amass extensive amounts of data that provide insights into the preferences of millions of customers in mere moments.
Business analysts now play the crucial role of deciphering this readily available data, transforming it into meaningful and actionable strategies. This data-driven intelligence arms marketers with the tools to orchestrate targeted campaigns, enhance the click-through rates, display relevant ads, polish the features of the product and cater to the intricate details to connect with the desired audience more effectively.

Analytics in Transportation: Since the advent of big data, various sectors have been leveraging it to enhance efficiency and simplify processes, one of which is transportation. Here are several areas wherein big data is significantly impacting transportation:

- **Route Planning:** Through the analysis of big data, one can gain insights into user behaviour pertaining to different routes and various means of transportation. This data-driven understanding can pave the way for optimized route planning aimed at reduced wait times and a smoother commuting experience for travellers.
- **Congestion Reduction and Traffic Monitoring:** Big data allows for real-time analysis and prediction of congestion and traffic flow patterns. A concrete example of this application can be found in everyday utilities like Google Maps, which uses big data to present users with the most efficient, least congested routes for their journeys.
- **Traffic Intensity and Safety:** The real-time processing potential of big data, coupled with predictive analytics, can be instrumental in identifying areas with a high probability of traffic accidents. This data-centric approach can effectively reduce accident incidences, consequently enhancing the overall safety quotient of traffic and travel.

Analytics in Healthcare: The healthcare sector is an industry that is undoubtedly generating a copious amount of data. Below are several ways in which big data is enhancing healthcare:

- **Cost Efficiency in Treatments:** By analysing big data, healthcare providers can reduce the overall cost of treatments. This is possible because big data minimizes the need for unnecessary diagnoses, making the treatment process more streamlined and economical.
- **Disease Outbreak Prediction & Prevention:** Big data plays a vital role in predicting potential disease outbreaks. It also aids in determining what preventive steps can be implemented to mitigate the effects of such epidemics, squarely putting preventive healthcare in the forefront.
- **Early Disease Detection:** Big data's primary healthcare utility is early detection of avoidable diseases. Early identification not only prevents the condition from deteriorating but also increases the effectiveness of the treatment plan, thereby improving patient outcomes.
- **Evidence-based Treatments:** Patients reap benefits from evidence-based medicine, which is a systematic approach to clinical problem solving that allows the integration of the best available research evidence with clinical expertise and patient values. This is made possible through the analysis of vast amounts of past medical records and results using big data.

It comes as no surprise that business analytics is garnering such widespread enthusiasm, considering its diverse range of applications. The crux of its impact relies not on the sheer volume of data an organization can amass, but on the way this collected data is utilized.

<br>
The value lies in the extraction of actionable insights from the mass of information, transforming raw data into a framework for strategic decision-making. These insights have the potential to drive business transformation, empowering organizations to constantly evolve and adapt to changing scenarios.

<br>
Data analytics solutions simplify the process of gleaning these insights, analysing the collected data accurately and swiftly. They allow even complex data sets to be transformed into an understandable format, making it easy for different levels of an organization to use the data effectively.

<br>
Prospective applications of these solutions span almost every industry vertical. From augmenting healthcare delivery to predicting traffic and enhancing customer experiences, big data is reshaping traditional business models and aiding societies at large. The potential of data analytics transcends beyond mere commercial benefits - it has the power to foster impactful societal change, revolutionizing sectors from education to urban planning.

<br>
All in all, data analytics is opening up vast opportunities - but it calls for the right strategies to unlock its full potential. With the right approach, tools and skills, powerful benefits can be reaped from the colossal amounts of data now at our disposal (ntellipaat, 2023.).
