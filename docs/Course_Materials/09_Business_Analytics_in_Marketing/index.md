## Business Analytics in Marketing and Customer Insights

In marketing, consumption represents the process of consumers purchasing and utilizing goods and services. This action is a central pillar of marketing, as the culmination of all marketing efforts revolves around it. A myriad of strategies such as product creation, pricing systems, promotional methods, and distribution logistics are employed by marketers to steer consumption habits.

Several key factors that shape consumer consumption include:

- **Needs vs. Wants:** Consumers make purchases to satisfy both their essential needs and non-essential wants. Needs encompass fundamental requirements like food and shelter, while wants entail things that enhance living quality but aren't vital for existence.

- **Income:** The level of income a consumer possesses impacts their purchasing power and ability. Typically, consumers with larger income brackets have a greater capacity for consumption compared to those with smaller incomes.

- **Pricing:** The affordability of goods and services significantly affects consumption patterns. Consumers are naturally inclined towards purchasing goods and services that offer value for money.

- **Availability:** The ease of accessibility of goods and services also plays a large role in consumer consumption. Consumers tend to prefer products and services that are conveniently accessible to them.

- **Marketing strategies:** Activities pertinent to marketing like advertising campaigns and sales promotions can directly influence consumer consumption. These actions are designed by marketers to convince consumers to purchase their offerings.

A deep understanding of these factors related to consumption aids marketers in curating effective strategies. For instance, marketers can craft products that align with consumer needs and wants, competitively price them, and ensure their easy availability. They can further harness marketing activities to influence consumers to purchase their products and services (Smith, T. , 2014).
