Customer Lifetime Value (CLV), also known as CLTV, is like a report card on a customer's economic value to your company from their first purchase to their last. It is a tally of all the profits, beginning with their first buy, their repeat buys, and how long they continue to buy from your company.

It's like a measuring tape to see how loyal customers are to your brand. If you find the same customers regularly buying from you, it's a good sign you're likeable and you're winning at your business tasks. Plus, the higher the CLV, the less you have to spend to get new customers.

To make it more relatable, let's take a look at a few examples.

For instance, let's say a Honda car owner is happy with their vehicle, they might end up buying more Hondas in the future and their total CLV could reach up to $100,000. The CLV of a coffee enthusiast can also be high depending on how much coffee they drink daily and where they get it from. On the other hand, a person buying only two homes in their lifetime could have a CLV of roughly $15,000 to a real estate agent. Although the home price is high, the agent's commission is just a small fraction.

In essence, customer lifetime value is like a yardstick for the potential profit a specific customer brings, and it should guide how much you're ready to invest to keep them. For instance, if a customer's CLV is $500, it would not make financial sense to spend more than that to retain them.

A good comprehension of your CLV can be a big help in shaping your business plans. If you know your CLV well, you might focus more on keeping your current customers happy, instead of using resources to get new ones. Of course, both new and current customers are important to grow your business.
