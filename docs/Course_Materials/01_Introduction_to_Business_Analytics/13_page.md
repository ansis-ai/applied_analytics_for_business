## Type of Business Analytics

Data holds immense value in today's rapidly changing market landscape. Professionals across various industries gather, analyse, and understand data to make informed choices and enhance their organization's performance. This entire process is called business analytics, which comes in four different types: descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive.

### Descriptive Analytics

Descriptve analytic sforms the base and addresses the question: "What happened?" By using current and historical data, it illustrates trends and connections. Think about a business monitoring its website traffic over time to see how its online presence has changed.

#### Descriptive Analytics with Sales Data
   - **Scenario:** A retail company wants to understand its sales performance over the last quarter.
   - **Data Source:** Sales transactions recorded in spreadsheets or databases.
   - **Techniques:** Use descriptive statistics to summarize sales data, identifying trends, averages, and outliers.
   - **Tools:** Excel or SQL for data extraction and summary; visualization tools like Tableau or Power BI for creating dashboards.


### Diagnostic Analytics
Diagnostic analytics steps in to answer the next logical question: "Why did this happen?" It helps uncover the underlying causes behind trends and correlations among different factors. For instance, imagine a meal delivery company examining why customers are cancelling subscriptions to pinpoint areas for improvement and customer retention.

### Predictive Analytics 
Predictive analytics takes on the role of predicting: "What might happen in the future?" By analysing past data, it forecasts potential scenarios, trends, and events, guiding business strategies. Consider marketers using previous years' data to anticipate sales trends and plan targeted campaigns.

#### Predictive Analytics in Marketing
   - **Scenario:** A marketing team aims to forecast the success of an upcoming campaign.
   - **Data Source:** Historical campaign performance data, customer demographics, and engagement metrics from social media platforms like Facebook.
   - **Techniques:** Employ regression analysis or machine learning models to predict future campaign outcomes based on past data.
   - **Tools:** R or Python for statistical modeling; machine learning libraries such as scikit-learn.

### Prescriptive Analytics
Prescriptive analytics moves to the "What should we do next?" question. It considers all pertinent data to map out the best path forward. Picture product managers of a new mobile app using beta testing results to decide which features to include or exclude, optimizing the user experience.

#### Prescriptive Analytics in Supply Chain Management
   - **Scenario:** A manufacturing company needs to optimize its supply chain to reduce costs and improve efficiency.
   - **Data Source:** Supply chain logistics data, including supplier performance, transportation costs, and inventory levels.
   - **Techniques:** Apply optimization algorithms and simulation models to determine the best supply chain strategy.
   - **Tools:** Advanced analytics platforms like IBM Watson or SAS; optimization tools like Gurobi.

Employing these various types of business analytics together paints a comprehensive picture of the insights hidden within data. This approach leads to more informed decision-making and a deeper understanding of the stories data can reveal (The Four Types of Business Analytics: Driving Better Business Decisions, 2023).


## Elements of business analytics

Business Analytics is a bit like being a detective in the business world. Imagine you have a big box of tools to solve mysteries. These tools include data, which is like evidence, and information technology, which helps you gather all the clues. Statistical analysis is like using math to figure out what the evidence means, and quantitative methods are like using analysis tools to understand things better. Lastly, mathematical or computer-based models are like making a map to show you the way. All these tools help managers look closely at their business, just like a detective examining clues. With Business Analytics, managers can make better decisions, like a detective solving a mystery _(Krishna, S., & Swamy, K., 2023)_.

Consider Business Analytics as akin to being the manager of a sports team. Picture yourself in charge of a soccer team with a wealth of data about your players' performances, such as their speed and goal-scoring abilities. Business Analytics is equivalent to having access to all these player statistics. But it goes beyond that! You also possess tools to thoroughly analyse these statistics, similar to how a manager reviews game footage. This analysis helps identify which players are excelling and who might need improvement. For instance, if you observe that a player is exceptionally skilled at scoring goals from a particular position, you might develop a strategy to utilize that player more frequently in that role. This resembles how managers utilize Business Analytics to make decisions that contribute to their companies' success in the business arena. It revolves around utilizing data and tools to elevate your team (or company) to its highest potential.
