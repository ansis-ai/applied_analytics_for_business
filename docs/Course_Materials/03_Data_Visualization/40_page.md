Visual encoding involves representing data using visual elements like charts, graphs, or maps, which are more easily and swiftly processed by the human brain compared to text or numbers.

The significance of data visualization in conveying intricate insights concealed within data is paramount. This importance is growing as the audience for data visualizations continues to expand in tandem with the escalating volume of data. Presently, data visualizations are being consumed by individuals across diverse professional backgrounds. Consequently, ensuring accessibility and user-friendliness has become a pressing concern. While data scientists and analysts possess the expertise to extract pivotal insights from even intricate visualizations, this might not be the case for high-level business stakeholders or the average person.

<br>
Hence, the demand for effective data visualization has never been more pronounced. Effectively conveying data is an art, and yet, many data scientists find themselves trailing behind in terms of the design and aesthetic aspects of data visualization.

<br>
Listed below are some essential design principles for crafting visually appealing and impactful data visualizations that cater to a broad audience  (Koshy 2018).

## Melissa Anderson’s Principles of Design

The subsequent design principles for data visualization are sourced from Anderson's work in 2017.

- **Balance:** Achieving balance in design means ensuring that essential visual elements like colour, shape, texture, and negative space are distributed harmoniously. It's not about rigid symmetry on both sides of the visualization, but rather about even distribution of elements across the dashboard. It's crucial to consider non-data elements such as logos, titles, and captions, as they can influence the overall balance of the display.
- **Emphasis:** Emphasis involves directing the viewer's focus towards significant data by utilizing key visual elements. This principle is closely linked to the act of reading design principles. It entails being aware of what captures the viewer's attention in the artwork. When crafting data visualizations, it's vital to remain mindful of the central message and how the entire visualization guides or distracts the viewer's attention.
- **Movement:** Ideally, movement within a design should follow the natural reading pattern, starting from the top, moving horizontally, and then vertically. Movement can also be induced by employing complementary colours to guide the user's gaze across the page or through the use of animations.
- **Pattern:** Patterns are effective for presenting similar sets of data or datasets with equal values. Introducing disruptions in patterns can be a compelling way to pique the viewer's curiosity.
- **Repetition:** By repeating chart types, shapes, or colours, relationships between different datasets can be conveyed effectively.
- **Proportion:** Proportion plays a crucial role in indicating the importance of datasets and illustrating the actual numerical relationships. It can significantly enhance the viewer's understanding and experience. However, there is a risk of subconscious deception through proportion, as our brains tend to interpret data based on images. Hence, it's vital to accurately represent proportion in data visualization and remain critical of potential misuse.
- **Rhythm:** A well-designed rhythm is achieved when visual elements create a pleasing flow for the viewer's eye. Adjusting visual elements' arrangement can help achieve this when it's not naturally occurring.
- **Variety:** Variety in terms of colour, shape, and chart types captures and sustains the viewer's engagement with the data. Introducing variety can enhance information retention. However, excessive variety can lead to the oversight of critical details. When applied thoughtfully, variety complements balance and aids information recall, but overuse can result in visual clutter.
- **Unity:** Unity in design naturally emerges when all other design principles are effectively applied.

These principles serve as guidelines for creating visually appealing and impactful data visualizations  (Anderson 2017).

## Common Mistake to Avoid

The objective of data visualization is to effectively convey information to the intended audience. Nevertheless, there are certain challenges to be mindful of when endeavouring to achieve this objective while creating visual representations of data.

<br>
The following highlights seven prevalent mistakes often made by Data Analysts when illustrating their discoveries in a visual manner (Ginsberg, 2022).

1. **Commencing with Excessive Complexity:** The allure of crafting highly detailed, real-time dashboards can be strong. However, rather than investing extensive time in the initial version, it's more prudent to undergo multiple short cycles of prototyping, testing, and refinement.
2. **Employing Unintelligible Metrics:** Dashboards should employ metrics or concepts that resonate with a broader audience. The use of esoteric jargon and metrics fails to effectively convey the intended message.
3. **Overloading the Dashboard with Extraneous Graphics and Confusing Widgets:** Dashboards should prioritize simplicity in visual presentation over flashiness or excessive design. Rapidly and clearly conveying the dashboard's primary message should take precedence, as clutter detracts from this objective.
4. **Waiting for Complex Technology and Extensive BI Deployment Projects:** Traditional business intelligence tool implementations often exceed their anticipated timeframes. Delaying for such projects to materialize can result in prolonged waits. Dashboard solutions entail repetitive, iterative processes with incremental improvements.
5. **Underestimating Time and Resources for Dashboard Creation and Maintenance:** Despite a dashboard typically occupying just one page or screen, assuming it will be quick and straightforward to create and maintain is unwise.
6. **Failure to Align Metrics with Goals:** Dashboards should not merely showcase departmental activities but should establish connections between departmental efforts and the organization's overarching goals and objectives.
7. **Utilizing Ineffective, Poorly Designed Graphs and Charts:** When designing graphs and charts for dashboards, meticulous attention is essential. Adhering to principles for creating effective data visualizations is crucial to prevent dashboards from featuring inadequately designed graphs and charts.
